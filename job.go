// Func is one attempt at the work. It reports how many items it processed -
// return 0 when the work is not item-oriented - and an error if the attempt
// failed.
//
// A Func must respect ctx: the runner bounds it with the configured timeout,
// and whoever owns the process cancels it on shutdown. The bound is
// cooperative, as every deadline in Go is: it cancels the context, it does not
// interrupt the running function. A Func must return when its context is done,
// and must wait for its own goroutines before it returns.

// Middleware wraps a Func to add behaviour around it - recovery, context
// enrichment, extra logging. It is classic Go composition: a Middleware
// receives the next Func and returns a Func that calls it.
//
// A Middleware must keep the one-attempt contract: it may suppress the call to
// next, but must not call it twice or concurrently. Deciding when the next
// attempt happens is the caller's business, not a Middleware's.
