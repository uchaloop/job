/*
Package assignment picks one cluster to own a scheduled point when the same
deployment runs in several of them.

It is a pure policy: it reads no clock, opens no connection and keeps no state
between decisions. Every process computes the same answer for the same point
from the same configuration, so nothing has to be coordinated at run time.

	rotation, err := assignment.MakeRotation(assignment.Config{
		Clusters: []string{"el", "xc", "dm"},
		Current:  clusterName,
		Period:   5 * time.Minute,
	})

	decision, err := rotation.Decide(assignment.Invocation{ScheduledFor: point})

Ownership rotates over the clusters in sorted order, one point each:

	slot    = (ScheduledFor - Unix epoch) / Period
	owner   = sorted(Clusters)[slot % len(Clusters)]
	execute = owner == Current

# What it does and does not promise

It decides who should try, not that anyone did. If the owner of a point is down,
that point is simply not served - no other cluster takes it over, because that
would need shared state this package deliberately does not have. The work must
therefore survive a skipped attempt: keep it in a queue and let the next
attempt pick it up.

It also does not prevent overlap. A delayed attempt and its retry keep the owner
of their original point, so an owner still working on one point can overlap the
next owner's work.

With N clusters a point comes round to each of them every N periods. Three
clusters on a five-minute period means each one gets an attempt every fifteen
minutes, and the whole deployment attempts every five.

# Changing the deployment

A cluster added, removed or renamed - or a different period - changes who owns
which point, and every process has to be deciding from the same configuration
for the rotation to divide anything. Nothing here checks that they are, so a
rolling update, with the old and the new configuration deciding side by side,
produces duplicates and gaps at the same time.

Before changing the topology or period, stop scheduling in every cluster and
wait for all old attempts to finish. Then start every participant with the same
new configuration, accepting the pause. A rolling restart is not sufficient:
old and new configurations must not execute side by side. There is no hot
reconfiguration and no agreement protocol, by choice: either one would need
exactly the shared state this package exists without.

# What it needs from the caller

The identity of the scheduled point, not the current time. A pod that starts
late, or a retry of the same scheduled Job, must decide as the original point
did - so the caller passes that point in rather than reading a clock. A
long-lived scheduler takes it from its own grid, before any per-replica offset:
an offset staggers replicas, it must not move a point to another cluster.
